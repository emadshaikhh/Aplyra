        <h2>What We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Aplyra is a scholarship and opportunity discovery platform. We act as an aggregator and 
          information portal, connecting students with official scholarship providers, internship 
          programs, and government schemes.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          <strong>Important:</strong> We do not accept applications, collect sensitive personal data, 
          or process any scholarship/internship applications. All applications are completed directly 
          on official provider websites.
